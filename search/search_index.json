We really dug into some details about how the tech community can help\u00a0House of Friendship\u00a0serve our community and the citizens who are experiencing homelessness, food insecurity and addiction. Not by connecting with our wallets or our hearts, although it was a very emotional evening, but by putting our heads together to put our skills to good use.</p> <p>House of Friendship started in the 1930s, as John states \u201cone of the original start-ups\u201d, when a group of women took it upon themselves to start serving meals to the \u201chobos and transients\u201d of downtown Kitchener. That initial service of meals gradually turned into an overnight shelter, then branched out into providing hampers of food for families in need. In the 1970s and 1980s, House of Friendship started offering things like summer camps for women &amp; children and addiction treatment services, and they built on their services for the homeless by creating supportive housing options and spearheading community development initiatives. The House of Friendship also helped kick-start one of Canada\u2019s most innovative food bank systems.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2017/10/26/civictechwr-meets-house-of-friendship/#food-insecurity-in-waterloo-region","title":"Food (In)Security in Waterloo Region","text":"<p>The\u00a0Food Bank of Waterloo Region\u00a0collects food from all kinds of community initiatives and assembles it all in a giant warehouse. From there the food is distributed through 100\u00a0different partner organizations\u00a0including local shelters, church-based hamper programs, \u201csoup kitchens\u201d, and the House of Friendship. The House of Friendship actually distributes about 60% of the food bank\u2019s food out of their location at 807 Guelph Street. The food bank also supports programs at\u00a0St John\u2019s Kitchen\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Ray of Hope.

It used to be that each distribution centre kept their own records about who was accessing their services. This meant that we didn\u2019t truly have a good understanding of how frequently the same household was in repeat need of the food bank\u2019s help \u2014 regardless of which location or service they used to access help.</p> <p>Now, for the first time in decades, when a member of the community shows up at one of the food distribution centres, their name is in a central database, and we\u2019re starting to get a better understanding of usage patterns. It turns out that most families only rely on the Food Bank\u2019s services a couple of times a year, which is exactly what they want to be there for: emergency help. But there are some very small pockets in neighbourhoods within our region where families are turning to the food bank on a weekly basis. This type of analysis is only possible with a connected system across the region. With more data, maybe we could start to get a picture of the root cause of this food insecurity?</p>"},{"location":"blog/2017/10/26/civictechwr-meets-house-of-friendship/#what-does-community-development-look-like","title":"What does community development look like?","text":"<p>As we mentioned earlier, House of Friendship branched out from its initial service of food to take on community development. Not only do they offer\u00a0supportive housing\u00a0options, but they also provide\u00a0community centre programs\u00a0in low-income neighbourhoods. These programs include everything from food distribution to cooking groups to homework help to community gardens.</p> <p>The tech community can make a real difference by initiating and hosting workshops that teach kids to be producers of technology not just consumers.</p> <p>As producers, our children will grow up understanding how they can contribute to the evolving society of innovation-rich Waterloo Region.\u00a0InkSmith\u00a0set a good example of one way any of us can contribute to this reality.

Services offered right in the local neighbourhood are far more accessible for low-income families. You\u2019re not going to send your daughter on her own across town to the KPL, after school.

Realistically, we\u2019re not going to get to a point where there are no people ever experiencing temporary homelessness, just like we\u2019re never going to produce bug-free software. But it means that the goal is to have the rate where people enter the shelter systems to be equal to the goal where they \u2018graduate\u2019 to permanent homes.</p> <p>Measuring progress toward this goal is currently a gap. Tracking individuals is hard and to some degree, can be an invasion of their privacy. We don\u2019t know what happens to an individual or a family once they\u2019ve made it into a permanent housing situation: do they stay? Do they experience homelessness again?

The lab\u2019s mandate is to transform the digital services offered by the Government of Ontario. It might sound lofty and vague but, with the right tools and expertise in place, meaningful change is absolutely achievable.</p> <p>The keystone of this new user research lab is the \u201cEmpathy Lounge.\u201d This room is designed to look and feel like a living room, because that\u2019s where most people access Ontario\u2019s digital services. You\u2019re sitting at home on the couch, using a laptop, smart phone, or tablet, or maybe you\u2019re at a nearby computer desk, when you\u2019re looking up information about how to sell your car. Or you\u2019re wondering how your 17 year old is going to pay for college.

The lounge itself has a comfy couch, coffee table, warm lighting \u2014 and reasonably unobtrusive video cameras. From video feed, the user research team can remotely observe residents as they try to achieve their goals using Ontario\u2019s current and rapidly improving digital services.</p> <p>As part of the lab launch, the Ontario Digital Service (ODS) team hosted an \u201coffice hours\u201d event in Communitech\u2019s Area 151. This team is led by Ontario\u2019s very first Chief Digital Officer, Hillary Hartley. I won\u2019t try to do justice to\u00a0Hillary Hartley \u2019s track record here, but she was a 2013 Presidential Innovation Fellow, under the Obama administration, and one of the co-founders of\u00a018F.</p> <p> <sup> Sebastian\u00a0_Prins (Office of the Hon.

For example, at\u00a0ontario.ca/osap, prospective and existing students can quickly and easily learn about their options for tuition assistance programs. Even more recently, launched on August 10,\u00a0ontario.ca/waittimes\u00a0and\u00a0ontario.ca/health\u00a0now provide valuable, easy to navigate, and timely information about medical services in the province.</p> <p>The open house event was successful in launching the ODS initiatives and space within the community and laid the groundwork for the creation of a network of like minded individuals passionate about civic technology. Within this region alone there are several groups and initiatives \u2014 from Digital Kitchener and their Innovation Activator Lab to\u00a0TriTAG\u00a0and some of the initiatives by\u00a0HiveWR.</p> <p> <sup> FailBetter flowchart on the lab wall.

They strive to empower this diverse group to work together, exchange ideas and tools to improve the lives of the residents in and around Waterloo Region through the invention, innovation and evolution of technology.</p> <p>To reach that goal, over the coming months, the group is going to be trying a few things, seeing what works, probably failing, and trying something different. According to its founders, like everything in life, it is a work-in-progress. You can find more information on the team and the vision at\u00a0http://civte.ch.</p> <p>Both ODS and CTWR, in addition to other similar initiatives across the city, region, province and country, are excellent examples of how government and ordinary citizens are joining forces to solve real world challenges in civic technology.</p> <p>Do you have a message you\u2019d like to share with a group of technology- and civic-minded Waterloo Region citizens?

I think a lot of us\u2014myself included, and others at Civic Tech\u2014want to get involved locally, but it\u2019s not always clear how to start. Some people look to events as a way to engage, while others are interested in volunteering. But in both cases, the path to connection can feel scattered or hard to navigate.</p> <p>With the Volunteer Directory, we wanted to complement existing platforms like VolunteerWR, which do a great job posting volunteer opportunities. Our directory flips that model\u2014it highlights the volunteers themselves. People can create profiles outlining their skills, interests, causes they care about, and what they'd like to learn. Then, nonprofits can either request a specific volunteer or talk to us about their needs, and we\u2019ll help match them with someone whose skills align.</p> <p>We also recognized that many community organizations are stretched thin. They may have needs or ideas but not the time or resources to define a formal volunteer role. Our directory supports a more collaborative approach\u2014pairing skilled volunteers with organizations to co-create solutions or projects together. It\u2019s less about filling a shift and more about engaging volunteers as partners who bring valuable knowledge and creativity to the table.</p> <p>Shay: </p> <p>I started ConnectedKW while I was on maternity leave with my youngest daughter. At the time, I was trying to figure out how to stay socially connected and engage with the community\u2014but my availability was mostly weekdays during the day, which made it challenging. I wanted to get out and do things, but I kept finding myself missing events, even though I was following local Instagram accounts and checking different event calendars. It felt like there was no single, reliable source for finding out what was happening\u2014especially for family-friendly events\u2014so I decided to solve my own problem. I started building an aggregated events feed that focused on the kinds of things I wanted to attend. It was fun to create and genuinely helped me discover local events. After working on it solo for a while, I brought the project to Civic Tech Waterloo Region to see if others might be interested in contributing. I found a great group of volunteers who were eager to help. Together, we identified a new opportunity: creating a volunteer directory to connect people who want to support nonprofits with organizations that need help. So in addition to the events page, we\u2019ve added a local volunteer page\u2014and that\u2019s what the Civic Tech team has been focused on this season.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/06/24/season-4---project-connected-kw/#people-involved","title":"People Involved","text":"<p>The team of volunteers behind ConnectedKW has been absolutely amazing.

The team entered all the profiles manually through the backend and used the directory as a kind of internal showcase.</p> <p>In the second season, the team shifted their focus toward making the platform more self-serve and accessible to the broader community. Now, anyone can submit a volunteer profile directly through the website, not just Civic Tech members. The team also introduced a request form for organizations, so they can reach out to find volunteers through the site instead of emailing them directly.

In the picture below, the community garden is at the bottom centre, and the Sheraton plaza is up and to the right on Burrard Street.</p> <p> <sup> If I noticed a piece of litter here, I would throw it out in a nearby trash receptacle. </sup></p> <p>The first question was about peoples\u2019 willingness to care for the space:\u00a0\u201cIf I noticed a piece of litter here, I would throw it out in a nearby trash receptacle\u201d\u00a0and the next one was\u00a0\u201cI would be upset if someone vandalized this place.\u201d</p> <p>Both of these questions relate to our willingness to take care of a public space, and both got similar responses from the people surveyed. I think that these questions really speak to both a sense of ownership and a sense of community. I remember hiking the West Highland Way in Scotland, where parts of the path are 300+ year old cattle droving and old military roads. Every now and then (not very often) we\u2019d find a discarded wrapper from some piece of food, and we\u2019d pick it up, put it in our packs, and empty it at the next town we stopped at. We cared about it \u2014 and felt that it was worth keeping clean, even though it isn\u2019t \u201cours.\u201d I know I wouldn\u2019t do that on a busy sidewalk that is already in a state that is too littered to maintain.</p> <p> <sup> In what ways do city planners empathize with their users? </sup></p> <p>There\u2019s a difference between having a park, and loving a park. If we start to think about cities as products, we should start to think about who they\u2019re being designed for. I loved that Robin included this figure of \u201cThe Design Cycle\u201d in his talk. I\u2019m a product manager, so maybe this is just me, but it got me wondering how decisions are made in our municipal governments and urban design. In software product development, we have many different techniques for determining priorities. We analyze the tradeoffs between fixing bugs, solving architectural issues, or building new features. It generally comes down to trying to identify a target market segment and figuring out what problems those users (or potential users) have that we\u2019re best positioned to help solve \u2014 and how we can solve them most effectively &amp; efficiently. How are these same decisions made in urban design?</p>"},{"location":"blog/2018/03/11/urban-design--happiness/#further-reading","title":"Further Reading","text":"<p>There\u2019s no denying that our interaction with cities shapes our brains\u2026 In what\u2019s known as \u201cthe\u00a0London cab driver study,\u201d it was shown that London black cab drivers have a significantly higher development of the posterior hippocampus than your average citizen. This is the part of your brain that is associated with memory, and it turns out, also plays a significant role in spatial navigation. Do Uber drivers have this? How do our brains change when you introduce navigation apps?</p> <p>After Robin\u2019s talk, we got to chatting about building up vs out, and talked about how European cities manage to have density without high-rises, and the impact that has on the way people experience their cities. A book recommendation came out of this conversation \u2014 \u201cHappy City: Transforming Our Lives Through Urban Design\u201d by Charles Montgomery. Again, on the topic of happiness, we also discussed the\u00a0Mappiness project. This was an app that allowed UK residents to record their feelings in a time and place \u2014 with the intention of highlighting places that make people happy. Unfortunately, it looks this project has been replaced with a\u00a0commercial venture\u00a0that is targeted more at wellbeing in private spaces \u2014 home, school &amp; work. What do you think about using something similar to the Mappiness project to flag great public spaces around us in Waterloo Region? Would you be interested in helping to build a base technology for something like this or help fill it in?</p> <p>One of my favourite parts of our CivicTechWR meetups has been the follow-up conversations with like-minded people. During our conversation, one of our regulars recommended\u00a0The Information Diet, and I think this is going on my reading list. Right after (or maybe before?)
