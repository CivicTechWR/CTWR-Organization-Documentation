Not by connecting with our wallets or our hearts, although it was a very emotional evening, but by putting our heads together to put our skills to good use.</p> <p>House of Friendship started in the 1930s, as John states \u201cone of the original start-ups\u201d, when a group of women took it upon themselves to start serving meals to the \u201chobos and transients\u201d of downtown Kitchener. That initial service of meals gradually turned into an overnight shelter, then branched out into providing hampers of food for families in need. In the 1970s and 1980s, House of Friendship started offering things like summer camps for women &amp; children and addiction treatment services, and they built on their services for the homeless by creating supportive housing options and spearheading community development initiatives. The House of Friendship also helped kick-start one of Canada\u2019s most innovative food bank systems.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2017/10/26/civictechwr-meets-house-of-friendship/#food-insecurity-in-waterloo-region","title":"Food (In)Security in Waterloo Region","text":"<p>The\u00a0Food Bank of Waterloo Region\u00a0collects food from all kinds of community initiatives and assembles it all in a giant warehouse.

The House of Friendship actually distributes about 60% of the food bank\u2019s food out of their location at 807 Guelph Street. The food bank also supports programs at\u00a0St John\u2019s Kitchen\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Ray of Hope.

It used to be that each distribution centre kept their own records about who was accessing their services. This meant that we didn\u2019t truly have a good understanding of how frequently the same household was in repeat need of the food bank\u2019s help \u2014 regardless of which location or service they used to access help.</p> <p>Now, for the first time in decades, when a member of the community shows up at one of the food distribution centres, their name is in a central database, and we\u2019re starting to get a better understanding of usage patterns. It turns out that most families only rely on the Food Bank\u2019s services a couple of times a year, which is exactly what they want to be there for: emergency help. But there are some very small pockets in neighbourhoods within our region where families are turning to the food bank on a weekly basis. This type of analysis is only possible with a connected system across the region. With more data, maybe we could start to get a picture of the root cause of this food insecurity?</p>"},{"location":"blog/2017/10/26/civictechwr-meets-house-of-friendship/#what-does-community-development-look-like","title":"What does community development look like?","text":"<p>As we mentioned earlier, House of Friendship branched out from its initial service of food to take on community development.

These programs include everything from food distribution to cooking groups to homework help to community gardens.</p> <p>The tech community can make a real difference by initiating and hosting workshops that teach kids to be producers of technology not just consumers.</p> <p>As producers, our children will grow up understanding how they can contribute to the evolving society of innovation-rich Waterloo Region.\u00a0InkSmith\u00a0set a good example of one way any of us can contribute to this reality.

Tracking individuals is hard and to some degree, can be an invasion of their privacy.

For example, at\u00a0ontario.ca/osap, prospective and existing students can quickly and easily learn about their options for tuition assistance programs. Even more recently, launched on August 10,\u00a0ontario.ca/waittimes\u00a0and\u00a0ontario.ca/health\u00a0now provide valuable, easy to navigate, and timely information about medical services in the province.</p> <p>The open house event was successful in launching the ODS initiatives and space within the community and laid the groundwork for the creation of a network of like minded individuals passionate about civic technology. Within this region alone there are several groups and initiatives \u2014 from Digital Kitchener and their Innovation Activator Lab to\u00a0TriTAG\u00a0and some of the initiatives by\u00a0HiveWR.</p> <p> <sup> FailBetter flowchart on the lab wall. Photo by Jonathan Tonge. </sup></p> <p>One such group looking to be a hub and catalyst in the region is the nascent (stay tuned!)\u00a0Waterloo Region Civic Tech\u00a0(CTWR) team. A few of the co-founders of the group attended the open house to see the new lab and meet some of the people innovating within the various levels of our government.</p> <p>One particular feature of the ODS space, the #FailBetter flowchart on the wall of the lab, resonated with the CTWR team as it really embraces the spirit of what they\u2019re working towards.</p> <p>The CTWR mission is to connect citizens, civic innovators, technologists, community groups, governments, and entrepreneurs with civic tech initiatives. They strive to empower this diverse group to work together, exchange ideas and tools to improve the lives of the residents in and around Waterloo Region through the invention, innovation and evolution of technology.</p> <p>To reach that goal, over the coming months, the group is going to be trying a few things, seeing what works, probably failing, and trying something different. According to its founders, like everything in life, it is a work-in-progress. You can find more information on the team and the vision at\u00a0http://civte.ch.</p> <p>Both ODS and CTWR, in addition to other similar initiatives across the city, region, province and country, are excellent examples of how government and ordinary citizens are joining forces to solve real world challenges in civic technology.</p> <p>Do you have a message you\u2019d like to share with a group of technology- and civic-minded Waterloo Region citizens? Do you have a space you can offer for an evening to host a speaker and a working session? We\u2019d love to hear from you!

The \u201cPerson-Occupation-Environment\u201d model is a foundational conceptual model and model of practice in OT. It describes how factors related to the individual are only part of what impacts their health. The situation around them (environment) and what that person does (occupation) both also have a substantial impact on well-being.</p> <p>\u201cOT shifted the my understanding from a disabled person to a disabling environment.\u201d</p> <p> <sup> Robin Mazumder, describing the PEO model for health, well-being, meaning &amp; contribution </sup></p> <p>Disability is a factor of the environment. A friend of mine moved from Kitchener to Toronto a couple of years ago, and went from relying heavily on other people to help him get to work to being able to roll out his front door, onto the subway, and in to work. That\u2019s not to say that his life in Toronto is easy. Between snowbanks, obstructive people, broken elevators, locked doors, subway maintenance, and able-bodied people rushing the elevators, the environment continues to impact his mobility \u2014 just not as much at the design level, and less severely than the design of Kitchener-Waterloo.</p> <p>\u201cUrban designers play a role on the health care team.\u201d</p> <p>As an OT, Robin worked with a 37 year old man named Larry, who lives in a boarding home in a suburban neighbourhood. Larry uses public transit, walks, and cycles to travel within his city. He\u2019s on income assistance, has an intellectual disability, and experiences chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder. This is what his neighbourhood looks like.</p> <p> <sup> \u201cSuburban sprawl area\u201d </sup></p> <p>Is it any wonder that Larry experienced things like loneliness and isolation that not only are risk factors for depression, but also for coronary heart disease and stroke?</p> <p>People often make the assumption that cities attract mentally ill people, but the more work Robin did with people like Larry, the more he came to understand just how much impact environmental stressors could be having on peoples\u2019 mental health and well-being.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2018/03/11/urban-design--happiness/#measuring-oppressiveness","title":"Measuring Oppressiveness","text":"<p>Robin described a few of the ways he\u2019s using technology to do his research on the impact of urban design.

Can an answer to that question be objectively measured? Another study that Robin has conducted as part of his researched compared peoples\u2019 feelings about 3 pairs of spaces in Vancouver \u2014 an intersection, a park, and a laneway. He conducted a walking survey, asking people several questions about how they felt about the spaces.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to use the parks as an example here \u2014 because we often think of parks as being pleasant spaces, no matter what details go into their design. I won\u2019t go into the back story on either of these parks, other than to say that the first was built &amp; is maintained by a corporation, and the second is a community space.</p> <p> <sup> Sheraton Plaza </sup></p> <p> <sup> Community Garden </sup></p> <p>For me, two of the questions asked really highlighted the difference between how people felt about these parks. In the picture below, the community garden is at the bottom centre, and the Sheraton plaza is up and to the right on Burrard Street.</p> <p> <sup> If I noticed a piece of litter here, I would throw it out in a nearby trash receptacle. </sup></p> <p>The first question was about peoples\u2019 willingness to care for the space:\u00a0\u201cIf I noticed a piece of litter here, I would throw it out in a nearby trash receptacle\u201d\u00a0and the next one was\u00a0\u201cI would be upset if someone vandalized this place.\u201d</p> <p>Both of these questions relate to our willingness to take care of a public space, and both got similar responses from the people surveyed. I think that these questions really speak to both a sense of ownership and a sense of community. I remember hiking the West Highland Way in Scotland, where parts of the path are 300+ year old cattle droving and old military roads. Every now and then (not very often) we\u2019d find a discarded wrapper from some piece of food, and we\u2019d pick it up, put it in our packs, and empty it at the next town we stopped at. We cared about it \u2014 and felt that it was worth keeping clean, even though it isn\u2019t \u201cours.\u201d I know I wouldn\u2019t do that on a busy sidewalk that is already in a state that is too littered to maintain.</p> <p> <sup> In what ways do city planners empathize with their users? </sup></p> <p>There\u2019s a difference between having a park, and loving a park. If we start to think about cities as products, we should start to think about who they\u2019re being designed for. I loved that Robin included this figure of \u201cThe Design Cycle\u201d in his talk. I\u2019m a product manager, so maybe this is just me, but it got me wondering how decisions are made in our municipal governments and urban design. In software product development, we have many different techniques for determining priorities. We analyze the tradeoffs between fixing bugs, solving architectural issues, or building new features. It generally comes down to trying to identify a target market segment and figuring out what problems those users (or potential users) have that we\u2019re best positioned to help solve \u2014 and how we can solve them most effectively &amp; efficiently. How are these same decisions made in urban design?</p>"},{"location":"blog/2018/03/11/urban-design--happiness/#further-reading","title":"Further Reading","text":"<p>There\u2019s no denying that our interaction with cities shapes our brains\u2026 In what\u2019s known as \u201cthe\u00a0London cab driver study,\u201d it was shown that London black cab drivers have a significantly higher development of the posterior hippocampus than your average citizen. This is the part of your brain that is associated with memory, and it turns out, also plays a significant role in spatial navigation. Do Uber drivers have this? How do our brains change when you introduce navigation apps?</p> <p>After Robin\u2019s talk, we got to chatting about building up vs out, and talked about how European cities manage to have density without high-rises, and the impact that has on the way people experience their cities. A book recommendation came out of this conversation \u2014 \u201cHappy City: Transforming Our Lives Through Urban Design\u201d by Charles Montgomery. Again, on the topic of happiness, we also discussed the\u00a0Mappiness project. This was an app that allowed UK residents to record their feelings in a time and place \u2014 with the intention of highlighting places that make people happy. Unfortunately, it looks this project has been replaced with a\u00a0commercial venture\u00a0that is targeted more at wellbeing in private spaces \u2014 home, school &amp; work. What do you think about using something similar to the Mappiness project to flag great public spaces around us in Waterloo Region? Would you be interested in helping to build a base technology for something like this or help fill it in?</p> <p>One of my favourite parts of our CivicTechWR meetups has been the follow-up conversations with like-minded people.
