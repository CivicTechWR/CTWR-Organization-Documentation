# How to Pitch a Problem at Civic Tech WR

- Purpose: bring a real community problem, find collaborators, and leave with clear next steps.
- Format: 3-minute pitch + 2-minute Q&A
- Who is allowed to pitch: Beginners, students, public-sector folks, nonprofits, and curious neighbours—all good.

## What to focus on (problem > solution)

- Prioritize the problem context (not your solution idea). That helps us apply design thinking and invites diverse solutions.
- It’s also okay if you want to test an idea or “hack a solution” together—just anchor it in the problem and who’s affected.

## Your 3-minute pitch outline 

- Who is affected by this problem?

 - Name the people or groups, and where they are (e.g., “seniors in Kitchener who rely on buses after 9pm”).

- Why does this problem matter now? 
 - What’s changed or urgent? Any time-bound opportunity or risk?
- What exists today (to solve or mitigate the problem)?
 - Tools, programs, workarounds, policies, or past attempts (and their gaps).
- What would success look like?
 - Simple outcomes or signals (e.g., fewer missed appointments; faster sign-ups; clearer info).
- What help do you need from the community?
 - Data, introductions, volunteers with certain skills, user interviews, etc.
- What are you bringing (give back)?
 - Time, domain knowledge, user access, data, story, test space, feedback cadence, or sponsorship.

### Q&A (2 minutes)

- Expect clarifying questions about scope, users, constraints, and success criteria.
- If you don’t know, say so—that’s great input for discovery.


## After the pitch: breakout & next steps

We’ll form a small group around your problem to workshop and plan. Use this flow:

1. Cluster insights

  Categories the information you discovered about the problem. Put facts and observations on sticky notes (physical or digital) and group into themes. End with a few sub-problems.

2. Prioritize 1–3 themes or sub-problems
  Choose 1-3 sub-problems to priortize working on. Quick vote using impact vs. effort or community value vs. feasibility.

3. Brainstorm freely
  Spend 5–7 minutes of silent idea-generation, then share. Go for quantity, not polish or quality. For example "we'll bring polar bears to scare politicans into action on Climate Change" is totally acceptable idea at this stage.

4. Choose a solution to test
  Choose 1–2 ideas. Define the smallest testable prototype (MVP) for the hack night.

5. Plan the prototype
  Who’s doing what by when? What data/access is needed? How will we measure success?

6. Test → learn → iterate
  Do quick user checks. You can ask the community for critique and feedback, or user test directly with the right users. Capture learnings and plan the next loop. Then repeat
