# How to Pitch a Problem at Civic Tech WR

- **Purpose:** bring a real community problem, find collaborators, and leave with clear next steps.

- **Format:** 3-minute pitch + 2-minute Q&A

- **Who is allowed to pitch:** Beginners, students, public-sector folks, nonprofits, and curious neighbours — everyone is welcome.

## Your 3-minute pitch outline 

- **What is it?**

	- Focus on problem > solution. Prioritize the problem context (not your solution idea). That helps us apply design thinking and invites diverse solutions.

	- It’s also okay if you want to test an idea or “hack a solution” together or focus on gaining and practicing a skill (*for example, I would like to learn React and temporal workflows this season*) —- just anchor it in the problem and who’s affected.

- **Who is affected by this problem?**

	Name the people or groups, and where they are (e.g., “seniors in Kitchener who rely on buses after 9pm”).

- **What exists today?**

	How are users solving or mitigatating the problem?
	Tools, programs, workarounds, policies, or past attempts (and their gaps).

- **Why now?** 

	What’s changed or urgent about the problem? Any time-bound opportunity or risk?

- **What help do you need from the community?**

	Data, introductions, volunteers with certain skills, user interviews, etc.

- **What are you bringing (give back)?**

	Time, domain knowledge, user access, data, story, test space, feedback cadence, or sponsorship.

#### Q&A (2 minutes)

- Expect clarifying questions about scope, users, constraints, and success criteria.
- If you don’t know, say so—that’s great input for discovery.

## After the pitch: breakout session (same day)

We’ll form a small group around your problem to workshop and plan. Use this flow:

**Week One:** Breakout Session (same week as pitch)

- **Discuss the pitch**

	Ask more questions. Get deeper into understanding the problem & need.

- **Cluster insights**

	Categories the information you discovered about the problem. Put facts and observations on sticky notes (physical or digital) and group into themes. End with a few sub-problems.

## Next Few Weeks

**Week Two:** Mini Hackathon 

- **Prioritize 1–3 themes or sub-problems**

	Choose 1-3 sub-problems to prioritize working on. Quick vote using impact vs. effort or community value vs. feasibility.

- **What would success look like?**

	Simple outcomes or signals (*e.g., fewer missed appointments; faster sign-ups; clearer info*).
	It's okay if you don't know (*if you don't know, then we recommend talking to users to find out*).

- **Brainstorm freely**

	Spend 5–7 minutes of silent idea-generation, then share. Go for quantity, not polish or quality. For example "we'll bring polar bears to scare politicans into action on Climate Change" is totally acceptable idea at this stage.

- **Choose a solution to test**

	Choose 1–2 ideas. Define the smallest testable prototype (MVP) for the hack night.

- **Plan the prototype**

	Who’s doing what by when? What data/access is needed? How will we measure success?

**Weeks Three to Eleven:** Work on Project

- **Test → learn → iterate**

	Do quick user checks. You can ask the community for critique and feedback, or user test directly with the right users. Capture learnings and plan the next loop. Then repeat
