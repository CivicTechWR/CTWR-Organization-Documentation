## How to pitch 

Prepare a 3â€‘min problem pitch (+2 min Q&A)

- Anyone is welcome to pitch
- We recommend that you focus on the problem (and not the idea or solutioning to follow good Design Thinking approach)
- However, it's alright if you just want to try out an idea or "hack a solution" together 

## Please come prepared to answer these questions 

- Who is affected by this problem?
- Why does this problem matter now? 
- What exists today (to solve or mitigate the problem)?
- What help or data do you need?
- What are you bringing to the community (we expect you to give back)?

# The next steps 

The next steps would be to workshop the information in the breakout groups with the people interested in working with you

We recommend (following Design Thinking steps): 
- Categories the information you discovered about the problem. Put themes or categories. You should have sub-problems by the end of this step.
- Choose 1-3 sub-problems to priortize working on
- Brainstorm how to solve those 1-3 problems (go for quantity not quality at this stage)
- Choose one or two solutions to prototype in the hackathon
- User test. Learn. Iterate. Repeat!
