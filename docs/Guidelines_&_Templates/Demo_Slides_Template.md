## Purpose

This is a template for the demo slides at the end of the season. This template ensures a good storytelling and flow or explaining the problem, and solution. Feel free to deviate from it as you see fit to your own story. 

There are eight steps we recommend in telling your story. They go, as follows 


## 1. Opening Hook
- A one-liner story, visual, or stat that grabs attention.
- Example: “Every newcomer struggles to find X in our city…”

## 2. The Problem
- What was the problem?
- Stakeholders it affects?
	- Stakeholders, community groups, or personas

## 3. Team Involved
- Who was involved in the project?
	- Team members, roles, or collaborators.
	- Emphasize diversity of skills & civic spirit.

## 4. (Optional) The process
- How did you approach the problem?
	- Include quick visuals (sketches, sticky notes, prototypes).
- Key learning moments
	- Pivots, surprises, or user feedback that shaped the solution.

## 5. The Tech
- What Technology was used?
	- Keep it non-technical for community audiences (focus on “why it matters,” not “how it works”).

## 6. The Impact
- What difference did it make?
	- Metrics: # of users engaged, # of hours saved, $ saved, etc.
	- Stories: quotes from users, community anecdotes.
- What was the impact on Civic Community?
	- How does this project strengthen Waterloo Region’s civic fabric?

## 7. What’s next?
- Opportunities for continuation?
	- Next steps in development, adoption, or scaling
- How can others (esp. sponsors) help?

## 8. Call to Action
- e.g. “download our app” etc.
- End with team photo or logo + CivicTechWR branding.
