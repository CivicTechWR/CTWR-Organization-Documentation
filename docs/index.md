# 🧭 Oops, You’re Lost!

Well, well, well... look who took a wrong turn on the internet highway. 🚧  
Maybe you were chasing a goose 🪿 (or a goose was chasing you!) or following a trail of snacks 🍪 — either way, you’ve officially entered the **Land of the Lost Pages**.

But don't panic! We’ve left a digital trail of breadcrumbs for you. 🍞

## 🔙 Here’s how to get back on track:

[👉 Take me home, country roads ⤴️]([https://civictechwr.org)]

Or you can:
- 🔍 Double-check the URL (even autocorrect gets it wrong sometimes)
- 📚 Explore the footer for a site map if you're feeling adventurous
- 🧑‍🚀 Embrace the void and start a new journey

Either way, remember: even the best explorers get a little lost sometimes. 😉

> “Not all those who wander are lost.” – but you definitely are. 😅
