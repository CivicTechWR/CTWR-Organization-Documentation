# Well, well, well... look who took a wrong turn on the internet highway. 🚧

Maybe you were chasing a goose 🪿 (or a goose was chasing you as often is the case in Waterloo Region) — either way, you’ve officially entered the **Land of the Lost Pages**. But don't panic! We’ve left a digital trail of breadcrumbs for you. 🍞

## You can go back to the homepage: [👉 Take me home, country roads 🔙](https://civictechwr.org)

## Or:
    - 🔍 Double-check the URL (even autocorrect gets it wrong sometimes)
    - 📚 Explore the footer for a site map if you're feeling adventurous
    - 🧑‍🚀 Embrace the void and start a new journey

Either way, remember: even the best explorers get a little lost sometimes. 😉
